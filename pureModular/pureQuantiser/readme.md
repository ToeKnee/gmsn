Release Notes:
v3:
  Added CV Thru
    With no buttons selected, CV will flow through the module un quantised. The LEDs will light up in a VU Meter type behaviour. This is good for fault finding to show whether the input ADC and output DAC is working correctly.

  Remember Selection on Power cycle
    The module now remembers what buttons were pressed when the power is cycled.
