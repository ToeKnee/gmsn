Welcome to GMSN!

Your complete portal to building a DIY Open Source Synthesiser.

On the main [GMSN! Website](https://gmsn.co.uk/) you will find all the designs, PCBs and Panels, together with step by step instructions and parts lists.

The [GMSN! Forum](https://forum.gmsn.co.uk/) is where most of the chat happens.
Here you will get 1-2-1 support and personalised video tutorials.

This Github Repo contains the code for the digital modules. All of which are based on the ATMEGA328 microprocessor. This enable us to leverage the Arduino IDE and libraries. This speeds up code development and deployment.

There's also the [GMSN! Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwt7YFF0vUFElzAl-tT9rXA) for loads of great tips on getting started.
